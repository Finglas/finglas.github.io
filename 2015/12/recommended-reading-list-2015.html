<a href="https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2012/10/recommended-reading-2012.html">years</a>
here is my recommended reading list for 2015. As before some of these
books have been released for a while, but these are some of my
highlights for various reasons.</p>
<h4>Code</h4>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dependency-Injection-NET-Mark-Seemann/dp/1935182501">Dependency Injection in .NET</a></dt>
<dd>I had put off reading this book for a while despite numerous teams
having a copy. It turns out a good chunk of the book is applicable
to any language, with the later third being dedicated to actual .NET
solutions. The other two thirds of the book has expanded my
understanding of DI.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Effective-Java-Programming-Language-Series-ebook/dp/B00B8V09HY">Effective Java: A Programming Language Guide</a></dt>
<dd>Many developers recommend this book even for non Java development.
Many of the tips and advice included we not new to myself but the
book provided further insight and explanation. A good summary of
best practices for any OO developers.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Web-Application-Security-Beginners-Guide-ebook/dp/B006DVPWX0">Web Application Security, A Beginner's Guide</a></dt>
<dd>A good introductory book on security which provided a useful
refresher for myself as well as providing a platform for further
research on some of the key areas and topics.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B007MQLL4E/">Enterprise Integration Patterns</a></dt>
<dd>A useful sequel to expand on Patterns of Enterprise Application
Architecture. This book focuses more on messaging concepts, going
into detail on a number of topics. The content of the book is
expressed in technology agnostic terms, which has been incredibly
useful when applied to actual implementations.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/REST-Design-Rulebook-Mark-Masse-ebook/dp/B005XE5A7Q">REST API Design Guidelines</a></dt>
<dd>Much of the guidelines in here fall into the category of common
sense or industry experience. Despite this the guidelines provide
great justifications for API design. An essential reference for any
REST API.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Exercises-Programmers-Challenges-Develop-Coding-ebook/dp/B0170Q50LK">57 Exercises for Programmers</a></dt>
<dd>A highly practical book in the sense that the book is full of over
sixty practical tasks. Many of these fall into code katas which are
ideal for learning new languages or just staying sharp.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Practical-Object-Oriented-Design-Ruby-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B0096BYG7C">Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a></dt>
<dd>Despite the name this book applies to OO development in general
while the examples use Ruby. The ideas and concepts expressed in
this book have changed my view on OO programming. If anything the
book will make you think differently about how to design and develop
solutions.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fifty-Quick-Ideas-Improve-Tests-ebook/dp/B00XVFFK7E">Fifty Quick Ideas To Improve Your Tests</a></dt>
<dd>A light read with each chapter dedicated to a single, focused topic.
Many of the ideas are well known practices but with expanded
justifications and recommendations.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/HTTP-Definitive-Guide-Guides-ebook/dp/B0043D2EKO">HTTP The Definitive Guide</a></dt>
<dd>The guide to HTTP if you are a developer. Each area is explained
from high level concepts down to the nitty gritty details.</dd>
</dl>
<h4>Process</h4>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B00HNB3VQE">Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash</a></dt>
<dd>A great summary of applying lean concepts to software development.
Much of the content is familiar though the ideas applied to software
development makes this book stand out. This acts as a useful
refresher for lean processes as well.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Startup-Innovation-Successful-Businesses-ebook/dp/B005PR422K">The Lean Startup</a></dt>
<dd>One of the most inspirational books I've read this year. Full of
useful and tested practices that has changed my perspective on
beginning a startup. Interestingly much of the advice can be applied
to individuals working within larger organizations on smaller
projects.</dd>
