    <p>Everyone is new at some point. No matter your experience level. You're
either new to the team or new to the business. Being the “new person” is
both a blessing and a curse.</p>
<h3>You're New</h3>
<p>When you're new you come with no baggage. You're full of questions and
curiosity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do we do it this way?</li>
<li>Isn't there a better way of doing this?</li>
<li>Have you considered this instead?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all great questions for new starters to ask, and for teams to
hear.</p>
<h3>You Have a New Team Member</h3>
<p>When you have a new team member you gain someone with a fresh
perspective. They're full of questions and curiosity. Rather than
history, they'll be open to new and fresh challenges. A new member can
ask you to question current practices. It is very easy to overlook
problem areas only until someone with a fresh outlook arrives.</p>
<h3>How to be New</h3>
<p>There are two roles a new team member must play.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>Challenging</li>
</ul>
<p>The learning phase should involve questions, shadowing and pairing. The
goal is to learn about the system, the architecture and the business.</p>
<p>The second phase should be to challenge and question the status quo.
Provide better solutions, or ask for justifications and explanations.
This is both win-win for the team and the new member. They'll learn and
the team will gain a fresh insight into their successes and failures.</p>
<p>The key part of being a new team member is balance within these areas.
Too much learning and no challenging will benefit no one. Likewise
kicking up a fuss over every detail is not going to end well.</p>
<h3>New Starter Balance</h3>
<p>A past mistake I've made is swaying towards learning the system, versus
challenges areas that were clearly wrong or needed improving. This is a
tough area, as you don't want to rock the boat, but at the same time
some rocking is required. The key is to balance this.</p>
<p>Advice to my past self would to tackle areas that you can have an impact
in. For example a neglected process or area. By picking your battles in
this manner you can slowly build your brand within the team, further
allowing you to take on the more controversial challenges. For example
if you've been around for a while, and proven yourself you'll have an
easier time suggesting and implementing change.</p>
<h3>Lessons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Remember the <a href="http://johnstepper.com/2013/10/26/the-five-monkeys-experiment-with-a-new-lesson/">Monkey and Banana
    Analogy</a>.</li>
<li>Balance between learning and challenging when a new starter.</li>
<li>Start slowly when a new starter, stack up small wins over time
    instead of a big bang approach.</li>
<li>Embrace new starters, use them to test your processes and
    documentation.</li>
</ul>
