    <p>Date/time logic is hard. Throw in time zones along with daylight saving
and it's even harder. Recently a suite of tests that had happily been
running for months started failing. There were no code changes and all
the tests were somehow related to date/time ranges.</p>
<p>Despite this the production code was functioning as expected. It turns
out the API was explicitly setting the locale to use <code>en-GB</code>. However
the suite of tests were not.</p>
<p>The fix was simple. Prior to the test fixtures executing, explicitly set
the locale. In order to test this assumption and see the tests pass, a
temporary change on the development machine was required.</p>
<p>The locale was set on the development machine to another region. In this
case setting to <code>en-US</code> was enough to cause the tests to fail. After the
code change the tests passed. Any locale can be used as long as the date
format differs.</p>
<p>This idea is pretty easy, and is very close to my technique of <a href="https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2012/05/achieving-more-isolated-unit-testing.html">pulling
the plug on automated
tests</a>.
The test suite can now be run on any machine, even those incorrectly
configured and we can be sure the tests will still pass.</p>
<p>Going forward for any date/time tests I will make an active decision to
temporarily change my regional settings. With more codebases utilizing
the cloud, relying on implicit configuration should be avoided where
possible. In fact I would bet a large sum of money that many codebases
out there would fail this temporary locale change. Give it a go - pull
the plug.</p>
