<li>
<p><strong>Kanban</strong></p>
<p>The importance of value and flow are the heart of day to day running
at Codeweavers. During my time I've read books such as <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0566086654">The
Goal</a>
and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Toyota-Way-Management-Principles-Manufacturer/dp/0071392319">The Toyota
Way</a>
in which the likes of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Constraints">Theory of
Constraints</a> and
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System">Toyota Production
System</a> are
discussed. I was also lucky enough to visit Toyota to see these
practices in play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pair Programming</strong></p>
<p>A big part of our day to day work is done via pair programming.
There are huge benefits to pair programming, but being a graduate
within an organisation where pair programming is the norm is a huge
benefit. Graduates usually enter the workplace with no experience in
the business domain and limited technical experience. Being set
loose initially would be a disaster. Graduates therefore typically
shadow other developers often spending anywhere from weeks to months
until they able to commit any code without supervision. With
Codeweavers this was not an issue. From day one I was committing
code despite being the least knowledgeable member of the team. In
fact, my earliest memory of my first day involved fixing a defect in
a codebase of which I knew nothing about. Thanks to my partner, this
lack of knowledge was not an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature Toggles</strong></p>
<p>The concept of a <a href="http://www.upstarthq.com/2010/04/introduction-to-minimum-marketable-features-mmf/">Minimal Marketable Feature
(MMF)</a>
can be a catch 22 scenario. We want to develop tiny incremental
features for rapid feedback, yet our customers want feature X in its
entirety. In order to deliver features in this manner the concept of
feature toggles are essential. Essentially code which will toggle a
feature on or off is often deployed with any new features we
provide. This means if something goes wrong we can instantly disable
the feature without a new deployment being required. Likewise the
ability to toggle features enables half finished features to be
demoed to a customer within a live environment. Once a feature is
deemed stable, these toggles can be removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Work in Parallel</strong></p>
<p>Somewhat tied to feature toggles is the concept of working in
parallel or being "system green". In other words the mainline trunk
from which we develop from should be deployable at any time. A
benefit of working in this manner is if a feature needs disabling
the old code is always ready to be enabled, likewise if an emergency
fix needs deploying this can be delivered as soon as possible. There
are day to day benefits from working in parallel as well. By making
changes in parallel, at any one time the checked out code is only
briefly in a state of being un-buildable, if we developed in a big
bang approach, there could be hundreds upon hundreds of compiler
errors to wade through. The important concept when working in
parallel is to ensure the old code which is being extended, or
replaced is cleared away once the new feature is live. The last
thing we want is old code rotting with developers too afraid to
delete it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Best Practices</strong></p>
<p>It is fair to say that all the developers at Codeweavers want to
develop the best code they can. Due to this practices such as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29">SOLID</a>and
other best practices are discussed, carried out and encouraged.
While I'd say that via books, the internet and other resources I
have been exposed to these practices working in a industry scenario
makes these concepts much more important and realistic. We all know
what a "perfect" solution would be, however with deadlines and other
limiting factors sometimes a more pragmatic solution is required,
despite the inner perfectionists inside us all wanting to spend
hours refactoring to a better solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Failure</strong></p>
<p>There have been times when I have out rightly failed. One of my
biggest regrets comes from a feature in which I let the database
schema dictate the business logic. Needless to say as the business
requirements evolved, the code which was so dependent on how the
database persisted the data became near impossible to refactor
without a rewrite. This rewrite never occurred due to deadlines
meaning the feature had to go live despite myself feeling rather
ashamed at how badly things had become. Despite this failure, it
proved to be a huge learning experience and something I do not plan
on repeating. Every time I have failed, it has helped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Starting Again - "a graceful retreat"</strong></p>
<p>Prior to Codeweavers had I been stuck on a particular task I would
have slogged away at it until the problem was resolved. Often this
would mean fighting my way through a task into the early hours of
the morning. By applying the principle of a "graceful retreat" I can
very easily delete code and start fresh. Very quickly you will be
back where you were before but in a much better condition, having
learned from past experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spike Solutions</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html">spike
solution</a> is
essentially a throw away prototype developed before we begin a MMF
in order to learn more about the problem at hand, or to test various
solutions. The name refers to the fact that if you were to plot your
velocity on a graph, after having produced a prototype you should
have reduced the risk to the project, thus implement the feature for
real easier and quicker. Every time we have developed a spike
solution prior to an MMF developers often comments on how it helped,
either by providing a learning experience or simply enabling the
feature to be split into further MMF's. It is because of these
benefits I am becoming to the conclusion that every new feature
should have a quick spike solution prior to production work
beginning, after all it is not easy to write tests for code you are
not quite sure you know how to implement. Spikes enable this
confusion to be cleared away upfront, allowing the production
implementation to run smoothly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conferences</strong></p>
<p>For the most part I enjoyed university immensely. With regards the
educational aspects I would find that after an interesting lecture a
huge sense of motivation and interest within the subject. Spending
additional time outside of a lecture discussing concepts with others
was both valuable and fun. Having finished university I am a strong
believer that I should maintain this inspiration and motivation.
Thankfully Codeweavers provides the ability to further ourselves,
and I've been lucky to attend several conferences this past year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practice</strong></p>
<p>Having experienced one year of Codeweavers the old saying of
"<em>Practice practice practice</em>" still holds true. Whether it be from
books, conferences or general day to day work. No one can stop
learning or furthering themselves if they wish to continue day to
day software development. For this very reason I'm grateful, but
this rule bears repeating and I look forward to another year of
practice and improvement.</p>
