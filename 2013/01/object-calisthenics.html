  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Recently I ran a session on <a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2008/11/06/object-calisthenics-first-thoughts/">Object
Calisthenics</a>.
I was first exposed to this challenge a few years ago and personally
found it a fun, yet difficult experience. This is intentional as the
challenge is designed to push the boundaries of best practices. The
instructions are simple, there are nine rules to follow that <strong><em>must</em></strong>
be obeyed during a traditional kata. We chose the <a href="http://codekata.com/kata/kata09-back-to-the-checkout/">Checkout
Kata</a> as the
backdrop for this session. The teams feedback is as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Use only one level of indentation per method</h3>
<p>The team found this easy, and we discussed that following this to
some degree in day to day development would be beneficial. Limiting
the amount of nested code you have can improve readability quite
substantially.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Don't use the else keyword</h3>
<p>At first this seemed a no brainier, until people realised it meant
to favour polymorphism and not simply relying on an early return
(implicit else).</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Wrap all primitives and strings</h3>
<p>The team managed well with this, one example would be a pair
introduced an SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) to encapsulate a string and
price. We do this well in day to day development at Codeweavers for
domain objects, however we tend to fail in other areas such as data
access code. This is one concept we need to try and improve at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Use only one dot per line</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2009/07/13/law-of-demeter-dot-counting.aspx">Law of Demeter in
action</a>.
Once we cleared up the ideas behind this it was pretty easy for the
teams to follow. This is not a dot counting exercise, so it is worth
being familiar with the "law". Much of our code would satisfy this
requirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Don't abbreviate</h3>
<p>One controversial point that came up from this was regarding the
team who chose SKU as a class name. Some of the team disagreed with
this naming, though in terms of the domain (a supermarket) this is a
perfectly valid name, therefore this did not break the rule. On the
whole our code is named well, though our legacy codebases have many
abbreviations that can confuse and obfuscate the intent of the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Keep all entities small</h3>
<p>For new code, this is not an issue, however we find legacy code is
given less treatment in regards to the size of our entities. This is
something we should try to improve, though the teams found this easy
enough during the kata.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Don't use any classes with more than two instance variables</h3>
<p>Personally I find this an odd requirement, providing you keep your
classes small as per the previous requirement this tends to be a
less relevant task. Of all the rules to follow, this is the one I
could not advocate during day to day development providing you keep
your classes small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Use first-class collections</h3>
<p>My personal favourite of the rules to abide by, and one I have since
adopted into day to day coding. <a href="https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2010/12/lists-or-objects.html">First class collections can
simplify, and make code easier to understand as well as
maintain</a>
and optimize. We have numerous examples of this at play at
Codeweavers, and we should try to increase the amount of custom
collections we have, as opposed to relying on primitive collections.
For example, quotes is a better object than a array of quote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Don't use any getters/setters/properties</h3>
<p>The hardest of all the rules to follow. Most of the teams tried to
get past this rule by simply naming their getters/setters slightly
differently. At the end of the day, there were still exposing state
unnecessarily. We would never try to enforce such a rule for general
development, but <a href="https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2011/04/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html">for core business logic this principle actually
makes
sense</a>.
The areas where this falls down, is on the boundary of the system,
for example user input or output would be such scenarios where
getters/setters are the easiest, cleanest solutions. Each team found
this requirement the hardest to work with, which mimics my first
expose to the object calisthenics challenge.</p>
