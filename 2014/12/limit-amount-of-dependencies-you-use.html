<p>The more dependencies you use the more your tests are coupled to
implementation.</p>
<p>Consider the constructor below.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Finglas/78bf9d35ef691f642d29.js"></script>

<p>Code like this is common and difficult to work with. Each dependency you
inject requires a mock, stub or fake when writing tests. This couples
the implementation to the test despite the use of interfaces or abstract
base classes.</p>
<p>Every public dependency here increases the resistance for change. If I
was to remove the builder and replace with some equivalent code to
construct a <code>Bar</code> instance, the test would fail despite being
functionally equivalent. This is wrong.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/02/28/Interfacesareaccessmodifiers/">A constructor is part of the public API of an object even though this
is not detailed as part of
interfaces</a>
in languages such as C#/Java. Every collaborator that is provided by a
constructor should have a reason for being exposed as part of the the
public API.</p>
<h4>What Are Good Dependencies?</h4>
<p>Good dependencies are things that are out of your control or process
such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Databases (repositories, queries)</li>
<li>Web Services</li>
<li>Third Parties</li>
<li>Strategies (anything that needs to change dynamically)</li>
</ul>
<p>As part three of the series will detail - isolate your tests from these
sorts of dependencies, don't isolate your code from itself.</p>
<h5>Doesn't this mean you end up with God classes?</h5>
<p>No. As step one detailed - small, well focused classes are a good thing.
They just should remain as implementation details.</p>
