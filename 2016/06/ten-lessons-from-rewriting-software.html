<li>
<h4>It Will Take A Lot Longer Than Estimated</h4>
<ul>
<li>Its navie to actually think this but if a system has been in
    production for say five years, expecting to reproduce it in five
    weeks is not possible. You may be able to get 80% of the core
    functionality done, but the remaining 20% that was added to,
    iterated and stabilized over the remaining five years is what
    will destroy any form of schedule.</li>
<li>If your estimate exceeds three months, you need to reasses what
    you are doing by breaking down the work, or changing plan. The
    bigger the estimate, the bigger the risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Deploy Incrementally Via CI</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you aren't deploying to a live environment as soon as
    possible, any future releases are destined to be failures,
    troublesome or just plain difficult.</li>
<li>Soft releases and feature toggles should be used to aid constant
    releases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Morale Will Drop The Longer It Goes On</h4>
<ul>
<li>Probably the biggest and most surprising realization is the drop
    in personal and team morale.</li>
<li>If you miss a "deadline" or keep failing to ship, then morale
    will tank.</li>
<li>While software is never complete, a rewrite has a definitive
    target. If this target continues to move, team morale will move
    too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Users Will Probably Hate It Anyway</h4>
<ul>
<li>Predominantly the UI, but your users will complain about change.</li>
<li>Big sweeping changes often receive the most hate. A website I
    frequent had a major change both in visuals and the underlying
    technology used. While there was warning, you were left to your
    own to figure out where features were. This caused a great deal
    of frustration and negative feedback.</li>
<li>Small, incremental changes allow your users to keep pace.</li>
<li>Alternatively some tutorial or hint system can help reduce user
    pain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Do What The Legacy System Does</h4>
<ul>
<li>As many of the original developers will likely have moved on, no
    one is really sure what the legacy system does.</li>
<li>Even with the source code available, it is likely going to be
    hard to figure out the intent, afterall that's one of the
    reasons for the rewrite.</li>
<li>If you are not careful you will end up simply reimplementing the
    same legacy in a new language or framework. Always weigh up
    preserving existing behaviour versus introducing technical debt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Be Cheap And Quick - Use Stubs</h4>
<ul>
<li>When implementing the new system, <a href="https://blog.shaunfinglas.co.uk/2015/11/dont-build-thing.html">don't build a
    thing</a>.
    At least at first.</li>
<li>Use stubs to build the simplest, dumbest thing you can to get
    feedback.</li>
<li>Without fully integrating the system in an end to end manner
    you'll end up throwing away a great deal of code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Feedback, Feedback, Feedback</h4>
<ul>
<li>Early and fast feedback is essential.</li>
<li>With a working end to end system gather as much as you can from
    any stakeholders.</li>
<li>Chances are as you begin you'll naturally incur some additions,
    removals or modifications.</li>
<li>Waiting months or longer for feedback is a guaranteed path to
    failure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Thin Vertical Slices Over Fat Technology Splits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Avoid the temptation to have a UI team, a backend team and a
    data team and so on.</li>
<li>Splitting at technology boundaries leads to systems that do not
    integrate well, or worse fail to handle the required use cases.</li>
<li>Your first iteration should consist of all parts of the
    technology stack, in the thinnest manner possible. Combine this
    with early feedback and the fast development speed of stubs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Strangle Existing Legacy Code</h4>
<ul>
<li>When rewriting in increments or by logical sections the
    <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html">technique of
    strangulation</a>
    is useful.</li>
<li>Instead of releasing the new code as a standalone piece,
    integrate the new code into the existing legacy code base.</li>
<li>This may be tricky at first however over time the legacy system
    will form nothing but an empty shell that integrates with the
    new system.</li>
<li>The beauty of this approach is early feedback, and a guarantee
    that the new system behaves as intended.</li>
<li>The final step would be to replace the legacy shell with the new
    modern interface or frontend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Refactor Where Possible</h4>
<ul>
<li>Deciding to refactor or rewrite is never easy. Refactoring
    should be the default approach in many cases.</li>
<li>Old languages or unsupported frameworks are good reasons to
    adopt a rewrite, but this varies case by case.</li>
<li>If business agility is suffering such rewrites can be beneficial
    when using some of the techniques above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
