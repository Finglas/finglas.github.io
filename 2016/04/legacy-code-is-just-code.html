    <p>Try and define legacy code. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/275-5610177-1468962">Working Effectively With Legacy
Code</a>
states it is simply code with no tests. This is an almost perfect
definition, however it is quite easy to have code that is covered by
automated tests, yet is still considered to be legacy. Poor quality, or
missing test cases can provide a false sense of security.</p>
<h4>Legacy in the Real World</h4>
<p>Legacy code is scary to change or work with. Typically it is stuck using
an old language or framework which is too expensive to upgrade. Most
notable legacy code is often considered old. Developers or teams that no
longer exist wrote it and have long since moved on. Hence legacy code is
often ignored or over looked by the wise. To be blunt, most developers
consider legacy code to be crap.</p>
<h4>Just Code</h4>
<p>In the end legacy code is just code. It should be treated and given the
same amount of respect as your new and shiny solution. In fact legacy
code is more than that, it's proven. Unlike clean code you have
stagnating in your repository, legacy code has lived and breathed in
production. It may be far from ideal, but it works and it does the job.
Learn from it and refactor where possible. In cases where refactoring is
not possible, use specific techniques for dealing with legacy code
(exapanded in future posts).</p>
<p>In reality software developers leave features in their place, not code.
Much of the code I have written can/should/will be replaced but the
features live on.</p>
<p>The lesson here is to simply treat all code as equal regardless of its
status - legacy or not.</p>
