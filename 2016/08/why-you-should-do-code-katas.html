    <p><a href="http://codekata.com/">Code katas</a> are simple exercises that are meant
to be repeated. They are great for learning a new language or tool. The
goal is to learn something, not to complete them. In fact, if you don't
finish a kata that is perfectly normal as long as you take something
away. The beauty of code katas is they are small enough to be repeated
and possibly completed within small time slots.</p>
<h4>Takeaways</h4>
<p>Beginner or expert there will be something you can learn or take away.
Beginners should take away language skills, tooling tricks and more.
This is furthered when pair programming.</p>
<p>Experts should be inclined to try new solutions rather than rinse
repeat. Instead of solving the problem in the manner you do 9-5, try
something completely new. Solving a kata ten times the same way is a
waste. Instead solve it once, ten different ways. In short, experiment
in code katas, not your production code.</p>
<h4>Going Further</h4>
<p>Sadly a small minority seem such simple exercises as below them. No one
is above doing a kata. Constant improvement or training is essential
regardless of level. Katas alone are not enough to support personal
development. Experience, reading and practical development are all still
required. However when code katas are combined they are an excellent
aid.</p>
